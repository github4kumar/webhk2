Ladies and gentleman , fellow toastmasters and guests

HAVE YOU EVER GRADUATED AND FELT BOTH EXCITED AND TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT?
I want to share a special experince with you all. Its about attending my cousin graduation at Indiana University in Bloomigton.
It was a day full of fun, memories and looking forward to the future

The trip to Bloomington was an adventure. My uncle and I decided to drive, giving us plenty of time to talk and catch up.
We shared old family stories, laughed a lot and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Indiana.
The fresh air and blooming spring flowers made us feel like we were releving the past.

When we arrived at the university, the excitement was everywhere. Families were proud, graduates were thrilled and campus was alive with celebration.
Watching my cousin walk accross the stage to get his DEGREE made us so proud. The professors and alumini speeches were full of wisdom, encouraging the 
graduates to look forward to a bright future.

After the ceremony, it was the time to celebrate. We joined other families and graduates for a joyful gathering. We had delicious food, took lots of photos
and danced.
It was a great time to celebrate not only my cousin's achivement or milestone but also how close our family is.

As the day went on, we started talking about the future. For the graduates, this was start of a new chapter. 
The graduates were exited about achiveing degree , but little nervous about starting thier career and responsibilities of paying off thier loans etc.
My cousing had a mix of excitement and worried about securing the JOb in current difficult enconomic situation where job opening for freshers is low to none.
We talked about how important is to keep trying, staying positive and never give up.

Seeing my cousing graduate made me think back to my own graduation and how i felt back then. 
It was a reminder of how much we learn and grow over time and how much exciting stuff is still ahead.

In conclusion - going to my cousin's graduation in Bloomington was more that just a celebration. 
It was a trip filled with fun, memories and thinking about the future.
It reminded me of the importance of family support and togetherness as we face new challanges.
